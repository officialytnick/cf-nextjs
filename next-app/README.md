# convertfreely-next — scaffold

This folder contains the initial Next.js scaffold (TypeScript + App Router + Tailwind).

How to run locally:

1. cd next-app
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- This is a scaffold used during migration. The full tool set and components will be ported progressively from the `src/` React app.
- Use `lib/toolsData.ts` as the canonical source for tool metadata and SEO data until full migration is complete.
